NowTrack — ServiceNow Script Progress Tracker

Stop digging through logs or refreshing endlessly just to check your script’s status. NowTrack is a Chrome extension that connects to your ServiceNow instance and shows live progress for any background script. ⚡

🔍 Get Started

Install NowTrack from the Chrome Web Store.

Commit one update set to your instance — and you’re ready to go.

🧠 Key Features

🟢 Real-time tracking — see processed vs total records instantly.

⚙️ Works with any *.service-now.com instance.

⚡ Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds — no need to reload.

🧩 Lightweight and setup-free — plug and play.

🎨 Clean dark UI with color-coded statuses (Running / Done / Error).

🪄 How to Use

1️⃣ Commit the provided update set to your instance.

2️⃣ In your server script(Business Rule,Background Script, Fixed Script, Any Server Side) , call the ScriptProgressTracker Script Include and pass a custom prefix.

💡 Pro Tip: Use a unique prefix for each script to keep trackers separate. Then open your Chrome extension and watch your script’s progress update in real time. ⚙️✨
<xmp>
(function() {
    var prefix = 'Incident Mass Update';
    var tracker = new ScriptProgressTracker(prefix);
    var gr = new GlideRecord('incident');
    gr.query();
    var total = gr.getRowCount();
    tracker.start(total);
    var processed = 0;
    while (gr.next()) {
        try {
            gr.active = false;
            gr.update();
            processed++;
            if (processed % 50 == 0) {
                tracker.step(50);
            }
        } catch (e) {
            tracker.fail(e.message);
            return;
        }
    }
    tracker.step(processed % 50);
    tracker.finish();
})();
